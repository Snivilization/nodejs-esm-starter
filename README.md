# nodejs-esm-starter

Starter project for NodeJs esm packages, with esbuild, typescript, mocha, chai, eslint, istanbul/nyc, gulp

:gift: This starter was created from the information gleaned from the excellent suite of articles written by 'Gil Tayar': [Using ES Modules (ESM) in Node.js: A Practical Guide (Part 1)](https://gils-blog.tayar.org/posts/using-jsm-esm-in-nodejs-a-practical-guide-part-1/), which I would highly recommend to anyone wishing to get a full understanding of ESM modules with NodeJS and provides the full picture lacking in other offical documentation sources.
